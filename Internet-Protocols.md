# Internet Protocols

In today's world, we are searching on Google, making friends on Facebook, sharing photos/videos on Instagram/Snapchat, Chating with Friends on Whatsapp, Watching video/livestream on youtube, etc. Ever wonder whats happen, when you see a live stream? How somebody could send a live stream video to thousands of Fans immediately.

This works when all are connected to some network, mobile data or WiFi. That's where networking and Internet Protocols works along with other layer of Protocols. It was not always that easy to see live stream or video on Internet. It got evolved over time to what it is today.

All of the communication on wire in Digital Era of ours started with one landmark research paper, ***A Mathematical Theory of Communication*** by **Claude Elwood Shannon** in 1948. This one paper started the field of *Information Theory*. 

**Information theory** studies the transmission, processing, extraction, and utilization of information. Information is your text/photo/audio/video, Shannon defined Information in more generic nature that we will see later. One of the application of Information theory covers Information (e.g. text) that needs to be transmitted over unreliable medium, e.g. Wifi, Mobile Network, LAN, etc., then quanitified again to the same Information that was transmitted.
