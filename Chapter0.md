# Introduction

This book will explore Web Architecture from the ground up to the current level of Streaming Architectures and beyond. It means this book will explore how we reached these architectures from the Analytical Engine. There are different eras where a certain set of technologies, we used in current systems, got a major push. Each era gave us advancement in a certain direction to reach where we are right now. Some advancement becomes obsolete and some become core that we now consider as obvious. It is like Human Evolution stages/eras,

 1. [Stone Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age#Beginning_of_the_Stone_Age)
 2. Fire Usage
 3. Cooking
 4. Clothes
 5. Speech
 6. [Modern humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity)

We now don't consider Fire, cooking, clothes, speech, etc as a major achievement. Since that become core of humans. Now, we are concentrating more on Intelligence, where computers are part of eco-system. Of course, the Era of Computers or Computing is the only fraction of Modern humans. However, we now have more documentation to look at things closely and then learn fast and then adopt those changes from learning and then documenting those learning and changes along the way. If Modern humans Era is an era of Intelligence building than we are into later stages of that Era and now evolving to create Intelligence in machines. 

The different Eras/Stages of Computing hardware gave us some milestones for the next era. 

 1. Pre-20th century
 1. First General-purpose Computer
 1. Digital Computers
 1. Mobile Computers
 1. IoT (Internet of Things) specialized hardware

Before looking at these in more details. Let's digress slightly to focus on one thing that add more value to the overall book. In this book, we also discuss **value**, either monetary or otherwise, of the solutions. The value of a solution is what derive humans to achieve that success and evolution of humans as a society. 

### 1. Pre-20th Century

Humans always have fond of computing devices because they eased up records keeping, transactions' calculations, astronomical calculations and navigational calculations. If you look at earlier computing tools like Tally sticks that were used to record number and other information that help in bilateral trades and debts. The value addition that brought by Tally sticks were related to trades/debts ledger. Not mentioning money here as money might not be present in that era of human evolution. However, if you look back that in today's perspective that adds value in monetary terms. 

Abacus was another computing device that eases out arithmetic tasks. Value addition of Abacus was in ways like counting important things for record-keeping, frequent trades in large numbers, etc. Progression from *Abacus* to *Calculators* involved computing advances to ease out calculations.

Timekeeping devices were also evolved from *Looking at Sun and Moon* to *Stonehenge* to *Sundials* to *Hourglass* to *Clock towers* to *Wristwatch* to *Electric clock* to *Atomic clock*. All of these involved major computing advancements in different fields over the periods of centuries. The value those enhancements brought in was from better coordination to better farming to better fishing etc. That leads us to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) and different time-zones and daylight saving times. Time zones to coordinate things locally to region or country. Daylight saving times to better utilize local daylight. UTC to coordinate things across the globe e.g International Air travel coordination, Ships coordination, etc. It still looks like a mess to many programmers but coordination at that scale leads to some in-efficiencies and managing that is also getting more and more streamlined. 

We will not go into details of all the pre-20th Century advancements since that will be a waste of time. In the pre-20th Century, two things are worth mentioning *Difference engine* and *Analytical Engine*. Difference engine was the marvel of its time. The time of complex mathematics getting solved by machines for specific purposes. Difference engine was the automatic polynomial solver of that time. That idea of Difference engine led *Charles Babbage* to the idea of *Analytical Engine* which was the idea of General-purpose computer. 

Analytical Engine has an Arithmetic logic unit, Control flow with Conditional branching and Loops, and memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete. In other words, the logical structure of the Analytical Engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era.

Ada Lovelace was the first person to publish an Algorithm intended to be executed by Analytical Engine.

### 2. First General-purpose Computer
In early 20th Century, Scientist were using different kinds of mechanical devices built for specific tasks. Specific tasks devices keep hardware at minimal. In early 20th century, Hardware was Mechanical devices and those were huge. These Mechanical devices or Analog Computers needed high precision and highly skilled workers needed for precision forging. Still error rates were high and that in fact one of the reasons for increased costs. Maintainence of those mechanical devices were also high. Also, size of these mechnical devices were enormous.

Starting of 20th Century was also quite unstable, two World Wars happened in that period and because of these scenarios funding to build smaller and efficient devices were enormous. To cater to these needs with funding available, *Electromechanical Analog devices* were build in late 1930's. *Electromechanical Analog devices* were possible by invention of *Diode* (first Vacuum Tube) in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming. A vacuum tube consists of two or more Electrode in a vacuum inside an airtight envelope.

German engineer Konrad Zuse was able to create Z3, the world first working programmable digital computer in 1941, which was General purpose programmable computer based on vacuum tubes.  

#### Specifications of Z3

-   **Average calculation speed**: addition – 0.8 seconds, multiplication – 3 seconds
-   **Arithmetic unit**: Binary Floating-point, 22-bit, add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root
-   **Data memory**: 64 words with a length of 22 bits
-   **Program memory**: Punched celluloid tape
-   **Input**: Decimal floating-point numbers
-   **Output**: Decimal floating-point numbers
-   Input and Output was facilitated by a terminal, with a special keyboard for input and a row of lamps to show results
-   **Elements**: Around 2,000 relays (1,400 for the memory)
-   **Frequency**: 5.3 hertz
-   **Power consumption**: Around 4,000 watts
-   **Weight**: Around 1 tonne (2,200 lb)

Konrad Zuse also introduced world's first commercial computer, Z4 in 1945. 

#### Specifications of Z4

 - **Frequency**: (about) 40 hertz
 - **Average calculation speed**: 400 ms for an addition, 3 seconds for a multiplication. Approximately 1000 floating point arithmetic operations on average an hour.
 - **Programming**: holes in 35 mm film stock, punched on a programming machine
 - **Input**: Decimal floating point numbers, punch tape
 - **Output**: Decimal floating point numbers, punch tape or Mercedes typewriter
 - **Word length**: 32 bits floating point
 - **Elements**: (about) 2,500 relays, 21 step-wise relays
 - **Memory**: Mechanical memory from the Z1 and Z2 (64 words, 32 bit)
 - **Power consumption**: (about) 4 kW

These were incredible machine of its time. The memory of Z4 was mechinical in nature i.e. punch tape. Z3 and Z4 were Turing Complete machines. 

These advancement happened in the era of uncertainity and wars. These early computers either used for encryption/decryption of sensity information, accurate attacks to moving targets, scientific calculations by scientist for weapon of mass destruction including Nuclear to defense mechanism, etc. 

### 3. Digital Computers
The *Manchester Baby* was the world's first Stored-program computer. It was degined to use *Williams tube* as digital storage device. 

### 5. Mobile Computers

### 6. IoT (Internet of Things) specialized hardware


Do you wonder why are we discussing Human Evolution or Hardware Evolution? Since this book is about Web Architectures not about Human or Hardware. You learned about those things because Human Evolution is a well-known thing so you could streamline those thoughts of evolution going forward and then we discussed Hardware Evolution to make those thoughts more relevant to Web Architecture.
