# Introduction

This book will explore Web Architecture from the ground up to the current level of Streaming Architectures and beyond. It means this book will explore how we reached these architectures from the Analytical Engine. There are different eras where a certain set of technologies, we used in current systems, got a major push. Each era gave us advancement in a certain direction to reach where we are right now. Some advancement becomes obsolete and some become core that we now consider as obvious. It is like Human Evolution stages/eras,

 1. [Stone Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age#Beginning_of_the_Stone_Age)
 2. Fire Usage
 3. Cooking
 4. Clothes
 5. Speech
 6. [Modern humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity)

We now don't consider Fire, cooking, clothes, speech, etc as a major achievement. Since that become core of humans. Now, we are concentrating more on Intelligence, where computers are part of eco-system. Of course, the Era of Computers or Computing is the only fraction of Modern humans. However, we now have more documentation to look at things closely and then learn fast and then adopt those changes from learning and then documenting those learning and changes along the way. If Modern humans Era is an era of Intelligence building than we are into later stages of that Era and now evolving to create Intelligence in machines. 

The different Eras/Stages of Computing hardware gave us some milestones for the next era. 

 1. Pre-20th century
 2. First General-purpose Computer
 3. Analog Computers
 4. Digital Computers
 5. Modern Computers
 6. Mobile Computers
 7. IoT (Internet of Things) specialized hardware

Before looking at these in more details. Let's digress slightly to focus on one thing that add more value to the overall book. In this book, we also discuss **value**, either monetary or otherwise, of the solutions. The value of a solution is what derive humans to achieve that success and evolution of humans as a society. 

### 1. Pre-20th Century

Humans always have fond of computing devices because they eased up records keeping, transactions' calculations, astronomical calculations and navigational calculations. If you look at earlier computing tools like Tally sticks that were used to record number and other information that help in bilateral trades and debts. The value addition that brought by Tally sticks were related to trades/debts ledger. Not mentioning money here as money might not be present in that era of human evolution. However, if you look back that in today's perspective that adds value in monetary terms. 

Abacus was another computing device that eases out arithmetic tasks. Value addition of Abacus was in ways like counting important things for record-keeping, frequent trades in large numbers, etc. Progression from *Abacus* to *Calculators* involved computing advances to ease out calculations.

Timekeeping devices were also evolved from *Looking at Sun and Moon* to *Stonehenge* to *Sundials* to *Hourglass* to *Clock towers* to *Wristwatch* to *Electric clock* to *Atomic clock*. All of these involved major computing advancements in different fields over the periods of centuries. The value those enhancements brought in was from better cordination to better farming to better fishing etc. That leads us to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) and different time-zones and daylight saving times. Time zones to coordinate things locally to region or country. Daylight saving times to better utilize local day light. UTC to coordinate things across the globe e.g International Air travel coordination, Ships coordination, etc. It still looks like mess to many programmers but coordination at that scale leads to some in-efficiencies and managing that is also getting more and more streamlined. 

We will not go into details of all the pre-20th Century advancements since that will be waste of time. In pre-20th Century, two things are worth mentioning *Difference engine* and *Analytical Engine*. Difference engine was marvel of its time. The time of complex mathematics getting solved by machines for specific purposes. Difference engine was automatic polynomial solver of that time. That idea of Difference engine lead *Charles Babbage* to idea of *Analytical Engine* which was the idea of General purpose computer. Analytical Engine has an Arithmetic logic unit, Control flow with Conditional branching and Loops, and memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete. In other words, the logical structure of Analytical Engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era.
