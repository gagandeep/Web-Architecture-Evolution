# Introduction

This book will explore Web Architecture from the ground up to the current level of Streaming Architectures and beyond. It means this book will explore how we reached these architectures from the Analytical Engine. There are different eras where a certain set of technologies, we used in current systems, got a major push. Each era gave us advancement in a certain direction to reach where we are right now. Some advancement becomes obsolete and some become core that we now consider as obvious. It is like Human Evolution stages/eras,

 1. [Stone Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age#Beginning_of_the_Stone_Age)
 2. Fire Usage
 3. Cooking
 4. Clothes
 5. Speech
 6. [Modern humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity)

We now don't consider Fire, cooking, clothes, speech, etc as a major achievement. Since that become core of humans. Now, we are concentrating more on Intelligence, where computers are part of eco-system. Of course, the Era of Computers or Computing is the only fraction of Modern humans. However, we now have more documentation to look at things closely and then learn fast and then adopt those changes from learning and then documenting those learning and changes along the way. If Modern humans Era is an era of Intelligence building than we are into later stages of that Era and now evolving to create Intelligence in machines. 

The different Eras/Stages of Computing hardware gave us some milestones for the next era. 

 1. Pre-20th century
 2. First General-purpose Computer
 3. Analog Computers
 4. Digital Computers
 5. Modern Computers
 6. Mobile Computers
 7. IoT (Internet of Things) specialized hardware

Before looking at these in more details. Let's digress slightly to focus on one thing that add more value to the overall book. In this book, we also discuss **value**, either monetary or otherwise, of the solutions. The value of a solution is what derive humans to achieve that success and evolution of humans as society. 

### 1. Pre-20th Century

Humans always have fond of computing devices because they eased up records keeping, transactions' calculations, astronomical calculations and navigational calculations. If you look at earlier computing tools like Tally sticks that were used to record number and other information that help in bilateral trades and debts. Value addition that brought by Tally sticks were related to trades/debts ledger. Not mentioning money here as money might not be present in that era of human evolution. However, if you look back that in today's perspective that add value in monetory terms. 
Abacus was another computing device that ease out airthmetics tasks. That add value in more ways like counting important things for record keeping, frequent trades in large numbers, etc.
